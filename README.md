**Multinomial Logistic regression algorithms** implementation using **tensorflow.js**.

## Description:

Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. The outcome is measured with a dichotomous variable (in which there are only two possible outcomes).<br>
Multinomial logistic regression is a classification method that generalizes logistic regression to multiclass problems, i.e. with more than two possible discrete outcomes.

## Project goal:

In this project, the goal is to **recognize handwritten numbers** using **tensorflow.js** and the **mnist database**.

## Result:

Accuracy = 0.95
